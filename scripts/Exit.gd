extends Area2D
## Exit.gd - Detects evacuated agents reaching a safe exit.
## Attach to: each "Exit" Area2D node under a Floor's "Exits" container.
##
## NOTE: Agent.tscn has no PhysicsBody, only an Area2D (for precise, cheap
## overlap detection), so this listens for area_entered (Area<->Area),
## not body_entered.
##
## Thesis ref: Chapter 3.4.2 "The Environment (Digitization Layer)", Listing 3.1.

## --- Change from original ---
## Manager.agent_escaped() now receives this exit's node name so the escape
## log can record which exit each agent used (exit choice distribution metric).

## area_entered only fires on a *new* overlap. An agent that wandered into
## this exit's zone before the quake (and is just standing there, since the
## check above was blocking it) won't generate a fresh signal once the quake
## fires - it's already "entered". Without this sweep that agent would be
## physically standing in the exit but never get counted as escaped until it
## happened to wander back out and back in again. So the instant the quake
## triggers, check everyone already overlapping this exit right now.
